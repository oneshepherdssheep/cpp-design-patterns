# component

## definitions

General definition : 

> Allow a single entity to span multiple domains without coupling the domains to each other.

Definition from the book :

> A single entity spans multiple domains. To keep the domains isolated, the code for each is placed
> in its own component class. The entity is reduced to a simple container of components.

Personal definition :  

> If an entity handles multiple domains, create separated/isolated components so that this
> entity will incorporate them (like a container) to safely use them.
