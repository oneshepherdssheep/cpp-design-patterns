# Design Patterns

## What is this repository about ?

This repository contains implementation of Design Patterns in C++ as I have learnt them from 
[Robert Nystrom](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/).

I have learn about [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) in 2018.
At school no one taught us about Software Architecture and Design Patterns in particular.
I stumbled on the topic as I was developing a small video games and wanted to apply good practices.

I since liked them a lot and really appreciate the book [Game Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/).

All Design Patterns are grouped by categories as mentionned in the book by 
[Robert Nystrom](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/). I've implemented those Design Patterns with specific changes and 
examples that I devised for my understanding. If you want to get the exact examples from the book please check them
(the book is freely available in html format but, I would suggest to buy the book because it is a good book :) )
